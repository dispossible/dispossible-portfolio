            <p>
                I needed a new keyboard and wanted to give a custom mechanical keyboard a try. I didn't go all in
                assembling the entire base, but went with a barebones option. For my first foray into building a
                keyboard I decided to strike this middle ground balance between customisation and easy of setup.
            </p>

            <p>
                I went with the GMMK 2 96% from Glorious as my base system. I spend a long while debating an ISO or ANSI
                layout, and eventually went with to ANSI despite my full history being on ISO boards, as the options for
                keycaps were greatly increased for ANSI layouts. Who needs to type pound symbols anyway.
            </p>

            <p>
                For switches I have historically liked Cherry Blues and Browns, but trying to source a full set of
                Cherries in the UK was weirdly difficult. So I went with some Gateron Blues, which reportedly were
                comparable in feel and quality.
            </p>

            <p>
                Then finally the keycaps I went with was a set from Razer as I was planning on having a standard black
                set and then replacing some of the notable keys with some more unique ones.
            </p>

                src={image1}
                alt="A half built keyboard with all of the switches inserted and half of the keycaps on"
            />

            <p>
                Up to here I haven't said anything beyond, hey I bought a thing. But here is where the issues started
                and I had to start going off script.
            </p>

            <h2>Issue one</h2>

            <p>
                So the first issue, I was banking on the keycap set from Razer, which came with a whole bunch of
                additional keys to support various layouts, covering my layout. It didn't. I was missing a bunch, and
                had to reuse some of the wrong keys in the wrong places, so my Num0 is now a backslash, oh well at least
                I can type. I managed swapping keys up until my right shift, which is an unusual width on a 96% board
                (1.25u). I had no other keys that were this size.
            </p>

            <Image
                src={image4}
                alt="Several different sized shift keycaps next to a space on a keyboard that is not the same size as either"
            />

            <p>
                So as this key was likely one that I was going to replace soon anyway with a different coloured set, I
                just need a stop gap. Roll out the 3D printer and a quick stand in key is designed and printed.
            </p>

            <Image src={image3} alt="Screenshot of 3d design of a keycap" />
            <Image src={image2} alt="Close up of a keyboard with a 3d printed shift key" />

            <p>At this point I had all the physical keys present and I was typing.</p>

            <h2>Issue two</h2>

            <p>
                So now I had to overcome problems of my own creation. I had made the decision not to use the same
                keycaps in the same places as the GMMK 2 has them mapped. No problem I thought, I can just remap them in
                software.
            </p>

            <p>
                For the most part, yes I could, it was a pain to go though it all and set up the mappings, but I got
                there. However the one key I did want to map somewhere was the pound symbol, but I'm now using almost a
                full US layout, which doesn't have the pound symbol. Turns out it's actually impossible to map a
                character to a key if that character isn't anywhere on the current keyboard language layout the machine
                is using (excluding some hacky workarounds). But never fear, AutoHotkey came to the rescue on this one
                and I learnt how to write a quick AHK script that I could have running in the background that would let
                me type the character.
            </p>

            <Code language="c">{`>!3::SendText "Â£"`}</Code>

            <p>
                All of this work remapping keys then had to be redone over on my work machine. What a pain. I got it all
                mapped exactly the same first try /s.
            </p>

            <h2>Issue three</h2>

            <p>
                After using the board for a bit, I realised there was a design oversight; there are no status indicators
                on the front of the board. There was in fact no numlock indicator at all, while capslock had been
                relegated to a slow breathing effect of an LED on the side of the case, where the idea was you can see
                the pulsing lighting on your desk, however in daylight this was all but invisible, and in the dark I
                would have to be looking for it to notice.
            </p>

            <p>
                To solve this problem I started looking into the possibility of changing the boards RGB backlight in
                response to the state of the indicators. Looking into Glorious' config software was quickly a dead end.
                It's perfectly fine software, but it couldn't watch for the status keys and take actions based on them.
            </p>

            <p>
                So out with that software, and along with that software I also needed to change the firmware of the
                board. The GMMK 2 ships with a variant of the QMK fireware, so I needed to revert it back to the base
                version of QMK which I could then jump in and add functions to.
            </p>

            <p>
                Getting the QMK code pulled down and flashed onto the board proved mostly problem free following the
                README, with only a minor niggle where I needed a specific version of the QMK flashing software that
                could interface with the GMMK 2 in it's starting state. But a helpful forum post put me on the right
                track with that.
            </p>

            <p>
                So at this point I could write some firmware. What language is it in... C. Never written C before, how
                different from javascript can it really be?
            </p>

            <p>A few quick beginner tutorials and a lie down later, I was ready to start coding.</p>

            <p>
                Turns out remapping keys in the firmware is super easy. It's just an array of consts that are even laid
                out to look like a keyboard in the file.
            </p>

            <p>
                So in no time at all I had wasted all of the time I spent in software remapping keys (twice) and done
                that in the firmware. But that isn't why we are here, we are here for the indicators and the RGB.
            </p>

            <p>
                From the firmware docs I found the functions I needed. The first function was the fairly easy
                "rgb_matrix_set_color" which sets the color of a given keys LED, awesome. Then also
                "host_keyboard_led_state" which returns a map of the three indicator statuses as booleans.
            </p>

            <p>
                Once I had these two pieces the only other major function in the firmware I needed was hooking into it's
                display process. A bit of technical insight, the way that the RGB effects on the board are set is that
                they are updated in every cycle of it's onboard processor, so I need to inject into that process and set
                the RGB values on the keys I want. This is done with the callback function
                "rgb_matrix_indicators_advanced_user" which is invoked each cycle.
            </p>

            <p>
                Here is the first version that I wrote that could do the basic job of setting all of the letter keys to
                be green while the capslock was enabled, and the numpad to red with numlock;

            <p>
                After this proof of concept was working, with some back and forth bug fixing while I nailed down the
                syntax, I decided to go a step further and make it an animation rather than just snapping on and off. As
                well as making the hard coded colours a little better.
            </p>

            <p>
                Putting this all together it feels very similar to writing animations in javascript using a
                "requestAnimationFrame" loop, to put it in a context that I'm familiar with.
            </p>

            <p>
                I'm not posting all of the code here for the sake of brevity, but here is the central functions for the
                finished implementation;
            </p>

            <Code language="c">
                {`// vars for tracking the animation state
double caps_flood_position = 0;
uint32_t last_frame_time;

// This is basically the amount of mills to wait between 'frames'
// Bigger number, slower the animation. 16 == 60fps
const int FLOOD_SPEED_DIVISOR = 16;

    // Use the time difference between invokes to set how far to advance the animation
    uint32_t delta = timer_elapsed32(last_frame_time);
    double flood_amount = (double) delta / (double) FLOOD_SPEED_DIVISOR;

    // Update the position of the animation, either adding or removing
    // an amount based on the capslock being on or off
    caps_flood_position = updateFloodPosition(
        caps_flood_position,
        flood_amount,
        host_keyboard_led_state().caps_lock,
        CAPS_FLOOD_STEPS
    );

    if (host_keyboard_led_state().caps_lock || caps_flood_position > 0) {
        update_cap_flood();
    }

    // [Numlock code omitted for brevity]

    last_frame_time = timer_read32();
    return false;
}

void update_cap_flood(void){
    int flood_index = clamp(floor(caps_flood_position), 0, CAPS_FLOOD_STEPS);

    hsv.v = rgb_matrix_get_val();
    RGB rgb = hsv_to_rgb(hsv);
    return rgb;
}`}
            </Code>

            <p>
                Diving into a few of the more interesting parts of the code. First off I needed to disconnect my
                animation speed from the processor speed. This code is something i'm very used to doing in javascript
                animation loops and is achieved by tracking the timestamp between invocations, and advancing the
                animation only by the amount of real time that has passed. Once this was in place I could configure the
                playback speed of the animation with a multiplier, which I set to advance across a key every 60th of a
                second.
            </p>

            <p>
                I then started tracking the animation progress as a double value which would increase while the lock key
                was enabled and drop when it was disabled. The rate of the change driven from the timestamp delta I was
                tracking. The progress position was then fed into a function that would change the colour of the correct
                keys to represent that position in the animation.
            </p>

            <p>
                The final part of the code was to deal with removing the hard coded red and green colours. To do this I
                found another function in the firmware that would allow be to pull out the current main colour of the
                board, which I was able to get as HSV format, from there I am able to rotate the hue by 180deg, or 128
                as the value is stored as a hex value. This calculation is a easy shortcut to grab the complimentary
                colour of any other following some simple colour theory. I can then cast that back to RGB values and set
                it on the keys.
            </p>

            <h2>The final effect</h2>

            <p>
                The only outstanding task at time of writing is to order a new set of keycaps to replace the handful of
                placeholders and add some visual interest with other coloured caps.

                This project touched on a wide set of different skills; some coding done in a language that was new to
                me. Some new software utilities for flashing firmware. I learnt way more about keyboard functionality
                and specs, as well as what to look for when buying. Plus a little bit of 3D modeling and printing.
            </p>
